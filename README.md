## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this character counter and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Analyze the character, word, and sentence counts for their text
- Exclude/Include spaces in their character count
- Set a character limit
- Receive a warning message if their text exceeds their character limit
- See the approximate reading time of their text
- Analyze the letter density of their text
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
